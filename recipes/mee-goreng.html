            <li>2 tablespoon Oyster sauce</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot filled with boiling hot water, blanch your noodles just until loosened (20 seconds) and strain immediately. Do not oversoak them as they will become soggy. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Then in a small bowl, whisk together your noodle sauce ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a pan set over medium heat, add pork belly and let it fry until golden crispy brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Next add garlic and let this saute until soft.</li>
            <li>Toss in shrimp, fish cakes and let this fry until the shrimps become mostly pink.</li>
            <li>Sweep your ingredients to the side of the pan. Pour in whisked eggs and mix with the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Throw in chives and bean sprouts and cook until the veggies have wilted a bit.</li>
            <li>Add noodles with noodle sauce. Give everything a very thorough mix until everything is well combined. Transfer to the serving plate and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
