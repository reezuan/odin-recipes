[The Odin Project] Building an index page with links to recipes.

I am building an index page that contains links to other recipes. It's
not going to be a pretty website, but it's going to be important for
practising some (ultra-basic) HTML.

By the end of this project, I would have demonstrated the ability to
set up basic HTML boilerplate and add basic HTML elements to a website.
